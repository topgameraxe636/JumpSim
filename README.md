## Overview
Welcome to the Trampoline Battle Simulator Script, an innovative tool for crafting dynamic simulations of high-flying combat scenarios on virtual trampolines. This script leverages custom algorithms to model physics-based battles, perfect for game developers, educators, or hobbyists exploring interactive storytelling. Keywords like "trampoline simulation," "battle scripting," and "action game tools" make this resource highly discoverable for enthusiasts searching for unique programming projects.

## Features
- **Realistic Physics Engine**: Simulate jumps, flips, and clashes with precise gravity and momentum calculations. ‚ö°
- **Customizable Battles**: Define fighter attributes, trampoline sizes, and environmental factors for endless scenarios.
- **Multiplayer Mode Support**: Extend the script to handle AI or human players in networked setups. üõ°Ô∏è
- **Performance Metrics**: Track win rates, jump heights, and collision data for data-driven improvements.
- **Emoji-Enhanced Output**: Visual logs with fun emojis like ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è for jumps and üí• for impacts, adding a playful touch.

## Getting Started
To run this script, ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to fetch the files, though direct download is recommended via the button above.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install numpy scipy` in your terminal for core libraries.
3. **Configuration**: Edit the `config.py` file to set battle parameters, such as trampoline bounciness or fighter stats.

## Usage Examples
Launch the simulator with a simple command:
```
python main.py --fighters 2 --trampolines 1
```
This initiates a duel on a single trampoline. Experiment with flags like `--gravity 9.8` for realistic effects or `--speed-up 2x` to accelerate simulations. Ideal for testing game mechanics or creating fun demos. üéÆ
